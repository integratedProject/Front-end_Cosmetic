            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
            these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I
            am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
            created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
            friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
            existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
            drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I
            never was a greater artist than now. <br><br>
            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
            meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
            of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
            sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
            stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants
            are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among
            the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms
            of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty,
            who formed us in his own image, and the breath
